# Machine Learning & AI Projects

Welcome to my collection of **Machine Learning** and **Artificial Intelligence** projects! This repository serves as a portfolio where I document and share the various projects I work on, showcasing my skills and experiments in ML and AI.

Each project is organized into its own folder with detailed explanations, instructions, and relevant code. Feel free to explore, fork, and contribute!

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each dedicated to a specific project. Each folder contains:

1. **Code**: The core implementation of the project.
2. **Data**: Datasets used in the project (if publicly available or linked).
3. **Notebooks**: Jupyter Notebooks or scripts used to explore and test algorithms.
4. **README.md**: Project-specific details and instructions on how to run the code.
5. **Results**: Visualizations, output, or models created during the project.
